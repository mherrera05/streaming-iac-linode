Write about 1-2 paragraphs describing the purpose of your project.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to install the following packages and binaries on your machine. And Linode account as well

```
Linode account

export TF_VAR_SSH_KEY=<linode-token-value>
export TF_VAR_ROOT_PASSWORD=<linode-token-value>
```

You should see your environment variables running env command.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
